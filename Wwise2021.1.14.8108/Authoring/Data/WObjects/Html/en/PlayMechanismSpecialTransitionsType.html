<h2>Type</h2>
<p>A list of transitions that can be applied between objects in the container.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Xfade (amp)</strong> - Adds a crossfade between two objects using constant amplitude.</li>
<li><strong>Xfade (power)</strong> - Adds a crossfade between two objects using constant power.</li>
<li><strong>Delay</strong> - Adds a silence between two objects.</li>
<li><strong>Sample accurate</strong> - Creates seamless transitions with no latency between objects.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger rate</strong> - Determines the rate at which new objects within the container will be played. This option is useful for simulating rapid gun fire. Alternatively, you can use MIDI to post each bullet sound with greater precision. Refer to <a href="https://www.audiokinetic.com/library/edge/?source=SDK&amp;id=goingfurther__rapidgunfire.html">Simulating Rapid Gunfire</a> in the SDK documentation for details.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: There are some limitations and restrictions when using Xfade, Sample accurate, and Trigger rate transitions. A couple of notable ones are:
<em> Blend and Switch Containers do not work with crossfades (Xfade). A Random/Sequence Container&rsquo;s Xfade will fail when any of its child Blend or Switch Containers play; and
</em> Fade outs of stop Actions do not propagate on containers using Xfade or Trigger rate transitions. Whenever a StopEvent is called on the container, with a fade out value that is longer than the current segment that&rsquo;s playing, the sound will just cut off abruptly when that segment ends. The workaround to this is to use a Set Voice Volume action to create the fade and delay the Stop action.</p>
<p>Default value: Xfade (amp)<br/></p>
